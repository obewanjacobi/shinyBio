# Abstract

The classroom is becoming more of a technological advanced place with each passing year. It is becoming increasingly more common to use apps and other electronic forms of learning to be present in a class. In order to try to see this in action, our group has made an app for an Evolution and Ecology course at our college. This app was made using different probability models and theoretical differential equations in a Shiny App made in R Studio. The app is used to show/simulate a population's growth when there is a specific carrying capacity, birth rate, and death rate. The app's purpose is to help teach the biology class this lesson of a population with a carrying capacity through the use of dynamic graphs and an interesting yet easy to use interface. The app has been successful in the implementation behind it, as it is fully functional and ready for the classroom. To test it's use in a class, we have given a survey to two separate classes to test their knowledge of the subject. One class used the app and the other did not. *Insert results here*

# Introduction

## Question

Over the summer of 2015, I worked in a research group on Georgetown College's campus with Dr. White and Andrew Giles. Originally, we were working on learning about Data Science, and began taking classes in a Data Science Specialization Course online. After Andrew and I learned some of the material, Dr. White recommended we work on Shiny apps, and make a successful Shiny app by the end of the summer. We chose to do a project to do with the help of Dr. Griffith (a biology professor), and made a Shiny app for his evolution and ecology course at Georgetown. So the question arose, how well will this app work in the classroom setting with biology students? In other words, does using an app rather than learning the full and heavy math behind the model help students more, or does it mask too much of the details?

As mentioned, our app works with the math behind an evolution and ecology course. The app is used to show/simulate a population's growth when there is a specific carrying capacity, birth rate, and death rate. The app's purpose is to help teach an evolution and ecology class. Below I will explain the design and methods we used to make the app. To see our code, and more details on how we did our work, feel free to visit our GitHub repository for this project at https://github.com/obewanjacobi/shinyBio/tree/master.

## Significance

Using technology in the classroom has been an up and coming subject in the past few years. Schools all around the US and even out of the country have begun bringing in new tech to try and help enhance the learning experience to make it easier for students. So, the reason that my question matters is because if apps like these are easy to make, if they are helpful, then we can start integrating them into classes more regularly. Students wouldn't be required to try and understand the gory details of a subject that don't apply to them, unless they really want to. The teacher can easily regulate what is shown at one certain time versus another. When asked, future teachers prefer having apps because it helps to get all of the students involved in the learning process, as well as organize thoughts to help manage the class and how they learn.

Studies show especially for the subject of evolution and ecology (the course that this app was made for), because understanding the theory behind many things requires the conceptualization of some fairly difficult mathematics, biology students have difficulty learning it. This is referenced in the article *Creative Education* (2011) when they say "...population dynamics is a complex branch of population ecology that has an essentially quantitative nature. The effective assimilation of this topic should consider basic aspects of population theory, which involves the conceptual understanding of mathematical models." People are looking for new ways to teach this subject, and many others as well. Using an app like this one could make a huge difference to students everywhere. Other studies, like Scott McDaniel's article in *EScholarship*, show that the entrance of apps and applets into the classroom have actually increased results on tests. So making these apps more integrated into the way we teach could actually help students learn more easily.
